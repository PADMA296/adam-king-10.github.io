            <h3>Cultural Influences</h3>
            <p>I was brought up in a family of 6 with a very caring, empathatic mother and a hard working, practical minded father. My father's parents were Welsh migrants who 
              established a large and prosperous family in New Zealand as a result of their own decision to take a risk and work hard to start a new life in a foreign country.
              My mother's family were from Poland and Russia, they were forced to move initially to Australia and onwards to New Zealand due to racial and political tension in 
              their homelands prior to WW2. Because of what they had to do to create a new life for themselves and their family, my family's background inspires my values of 
              entrepreneurship and risk taking.</p>
            <p>Growing up as the youngest of 4 children was a big influence on my values and identity. I was constantly looking up to my older brothers and their friends, 
              trying to emulate them and get involved in their activities.</p>
            <p>My parents always taught us to be self-sufficient; they only did things for us if we knew how to do them ourselves, so we grew up learning to cook, clean up 
              after ourselves, organize our schedules, do laundry, and so on.Also, my parents were both working full time, so we would normally have to find our way to and 
              from school, sports practices, or other extra curricular activities. This part of my upbringing helped form my value of independence.</p>
            <p>I was heavily influenced by my family's sporting endeavors, whether it was my father playing and coaching rugby, taking me to play golf, or my mother playing 
              and coaching softball and leading teams to victory; exposure to many different disciplines of sport taught me a lot of the values I hold today and helped form my identity.</p>
