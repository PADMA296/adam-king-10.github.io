            <h3>My Long Term Goals</h3>
            <p>
                These have not changed significantly throughout foundations, although I 
                have rediscovered my enjoyment of creative design and user experience, so this could be a potential 
                pathway which I explore in the early part of my development career.
            </p>
            <hr class="blogcontenthr">
            <h3>Describing My Strengths & Limitations Related To Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Again, these have not changed significantly during foundations. One limitation that is stronger 
                than anticipated is motivation, I am extremely motivated by the career aspects but enjoying the learning journey is something 
                I need to continue putting a focus on.
            </p>

            <h3>My Biggest Non-Technical Challenges During Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
                I believe managing my energy levels and resisting not being to independent in my work will be my biggest challenges during boot camp.
            </p>
            <hr class="blogcontenthr">
            <h3>Soft Skills I Want To Develop During Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
                These have not changed significantly. I intend to try build a strong relationship with each member of my cohort and the bootcamp team, so in that sense it
                is networking skills I intend to develop.
            </p>
            <hr class="blogcontenthr">
            <h3>My Expectations Of The Bootcamp Team</h3>
            <p>
                My expectations will be a slightly more micromanagement approach than during foundations, but I still expect a good level of independence in my learning. 
                I will expect more of a steer on the technical front when challenges are encountered.
            </p>
            <hr class="blogcontenthr">
            <h3>Expectations of Myself During Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
                I am making a commitment to building strong connections with all members of my cohort and bootcamp team, this will help me to feel more comfortable when seeking help and
                working with others. 
            </p>   
            <p>
                I am also committing to continue the habits formed during foundations of weekly planning, daily goal setting, journaling and reflection. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I will try complete all my coding and study time mid-week, allowing me the weekends to spend on the leisure activities i enjoy and rest; However, I am realistic that 
                some weeks i may be required to put in extra time at the weekend.
